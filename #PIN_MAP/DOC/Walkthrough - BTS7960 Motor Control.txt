Walkthrough - BTS7960 Motor Control Implementation
Refactored the motor control system to use BTS7960 drivers on an Arduino Mega 2560, controlled via SPI from an Arduino UNO WiFi.

Changes Made
MotorDrive Library Refactoring
The 
MotorDrive
 library was updated to support the 4-pin control logic required by BTS7960 (L_EN, R_EN, LPWM, RPWM).

MotorDrive.h
: Updated constructor and member variables to handle 8 pins in total (4 per motor).
MotorDrive.cpp
: Implemented BTS7960 drive logic. Forward/Backward is now controlled by swapping PWM signals between LPWM and RPWM pins.
Mega Controller Update
MotorDrive_Mega.ino
:
Updated with the user's specific pin assignments.
Added extensive comments explaining the SPI wiring and command protocol.
Pin Configuration (BTS7960)
Driver	Pin Name	Mega Pin
1 (Left)	R_EN	5
L_EN	4
RPWM	7
LPWM	6
2 (Right)	R_EN2	10
L_EN2	11
RPWM2	12
LPWM2	13
SPI Protocol Summary
The following commands are supported via SPI (1 byte each):

w / s: Forward / Backward
a / d: Turn Left / Turn Right
x: Stop
+ / -: Speed Up / Speed Down
l / p: Line Trace / PID Line Trace
The Slave (Mega) responds with 4 bytes representing the current encoderPos (long).

Manual Verification Results
 Compilation: 
MotorDrive_Mega.ino
 compiles successfully for Mega 2560.
 Logic Check: PWM signals correctly map to direction pins for BTS7960.
 Documentation: SPI protocol and wiring are clearly documented in the source code.
